#summary How to use this in Axis2 transport

== requirements ==

* Apache Axis2 Server [1]
* Apache WS-Commons Transport base jar [2]
* Free Pastry [3]

== Configurations ==

 *Apache Axis2 Server*

 Free pastry should have a boot strap node to start a new ring.Therefore we need to choose one Axis2 server for that.For that server we need to give the following configurations in axis2.xml  (Found in conf folder)

*for transport sender*

<transportReceiver name="p2p" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.p2p.P2pListner">
  <parameter name="transport.p2p.bootip" >127.0.0.1</parameter>
  <parameter name="transport.p2p.bootport">10000</parameter>
  <parameter name="transport.p2p.bindport">10000</parameter>
</transportReceiver>

*for transport receiver*

<transportSender name="p2p"
                     class="org.apache.axis2.transport.p2p.P2pSender"/>

 *Note:* you need to give the same port no for bootport and bindport if you are going to bootstrap using the server.


For other servers and clients you need not to give bind port unless you need to create a new ring.

*note* if you are using 10000 as the boot strap please do not use 10000+1 port since it will be used by Registry Application


== Adding required jars to Axis2 server ==

you need to add following jars to the AXIS2_HOME/lib folder

[*http://www.freepastry.org/FreePastry/FreePastry-2.1.jar FreePastry-2.1.jar]

[*http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/archive-details/org/apache/axis2/axis2-transport-base/1.0.0/axis2-transport-base-1.0.0.jar axis2-transport-base-1.0.0.jar]

and then start the server.
